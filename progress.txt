## Codebase Patterns
- This project uses custom migration scripts instead of Alembic (see backend/migrations/)
- Migration scripts are located in backend/migrations/ and follow pattern migrate_*.py
- Each migration script includes path setup: sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
- SQLite requires explicit ADD COLUMN for missing columns (cannot auto-add)
- Use `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TYPE` for adding columns to existing tables
- Foreign key constraints are checked with PRAGMA foreign_key_check in SQLite
- **UUID strings are used for primary keys throughout the codebase**
- The Recipe model uses 'ingredient_relations' and 'step_relations' for back_populates to avoid conflict with JSON 'ingredients' and 'steps' fields
- JSON columns are supported but searching has limitations in SQLite
- Use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency
