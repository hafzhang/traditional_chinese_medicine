Image Matching Validation Acceptance Report
======================================================================
Date: 2026-01-31 11:18:25

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SCANNED IMAGE COUNT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Image directory: source_data/dishes_images/
Status: NOT FOUND (directory does not exist)
Scanned images: 0
Requirement: >= 5,000
Status: FAIL - Image directory not found in current environment
Note: This validation assumes images were available during import

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. IMAGE MATCHING RATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recipes with cover_image: 0
Total recipes: 12,783
Matching rate: 0.00%
Requirement: >= 40%
Status: FAIL (0.00% >= 40%)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. COVER_IMAGE FIELD VALIDATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recipes with NULL cover_image: 5
Recipes with non-NULL cover_image: 12,778
Status: Field exists and can store image paths

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. SAMPLE RECIPE IMAGE PATHS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
No samples found - all cover_image values are NULL/empty

======================================================================
ACCEPTANCE SUMMARY
======================================================================
Overall Status: PARTIAL (0/3 verifiable criteria passed)

Detailed Results:
  [1] Scanned images: FAIL (directory not found - requires source images)
  [2] Image matching rate: FAIL (0.00% >= 40%)
  [3] cover_image field: PASS (field exists and can store paths)

======================================================================
NOTES
======================================================================
- Image directory (source_data/dishes_images/) not found in current environment
- Image matching was performed during Excel import (US-023)
- Current cover_image values reflect what was stored during import
- To re-run image matching, place dish images in source_data/dishes_images/
-
- Image matching uses 4-step fuzzy matching:
  1. Exact match (after removing spaces)
  2. Normalized match (unify spaces, underscores, brackets)
  3. Synonym match (using FOOD_SYNONYMS replacement)
  4. Contains match (recipe_name contains image_key or vice versa)
